Description: This package automatically estimates 11 effect size measures from a well-formatted dataframe. Various other functions can help, for example, removing dependency between several effect sizes, or identiying differences between two dataframes.
    This package is mainly designed to assist in conducting a systematic review with a meta-analysis but can be useful to any researcher interested in estimating an effect size.
